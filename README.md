## Overview
One way to use a neural network model is to create a classification algorithm that determines if an input belongs in one category versus another. Alternatively neural network models can behave like a regression model, where a dependent output variable can be predicted from independent input variables. Therefore, neural network models can be an alternative to many of the models we have learned throughout the course, such as random forest, logistic regression, or multiple linear regression.

There are a number of advantages to using a neural network instead of a traditional statistical or machine learning model. For instance, neural networks are effective at detecting complex, nonlinear relationships. Additionally, neural networks have greater tolerance for messy data and can learn to ignore noisy characteristics in data. The two biggest disadvantages to using a neural network model are that the layers of neurons are often too complex to dissect and understand (creating a black box problem), and neural networks are prone to overfitting (characterizing the training data so well that it does not generalize to test data effectively). However, both of the disadvantages can be mitigated and accounted for.
